This was a project made after learning HTML/CSS to test my knowledge and learn new things about simple front end web development as I went along.

## What I learned
- HTML/CSS
- Responsive layout design
- Simple PHP for form usage to cause form to send me an e-mail with the data from the filled out fields
- Simple Javascript for form validation
