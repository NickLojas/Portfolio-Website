				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>My name is Nick Lojas, I'm from Mississauga, Ontario, in Canada and as you may have read on the front page, I am a computer science graduate from the University of Toronto. I've been into programming ever since high school where I took my first computer science class learning python.  Ever since, I've always known that I want to push the limits of what technology can do by creating and updating new and existing software on the market. What helps keep me motivated, is having many close friends that do a variety of programming with a few doing full stack web development, some doing front end web development, some developing software, and some developing games on unity which I've been eager to learn how to do.<br> On my own time apart from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, hanging out with friends, going to music festivals, and p0wning n00bs in video games. 
				</p>
				<h2>My Education</h2>
				<p>Throughout university, I majored in Computer Science and Math and graduated with a honors Bachelor of Science degree. As a surprise to most, Math (and similarily Computer Science) has always been enjoyable to me as I tend to be a great problem solver with a keen eye for little details in problems. My peers say that this has helped me get through school with less struggle than others.</p>
				<p>In school, I also learned many different programming languages which I use to this day. Some of which are Java, Python, Bash, SVN (Git), and SQL. I was also taught C, SML and a little bit of javascript through school projects. After school I took 3 online courses: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced on the Udemy course website taught by Mosh Hamedani to learn C# (I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to learn C#). I also started learning HTML/CSS/Javascript on my own time by watching youtube tutorials, and doing projects such as creating this website to apply what I've learned.</p>
